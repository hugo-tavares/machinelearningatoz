Logistic Regression works applying the sigmoid function to the linear regression.

p^ => predicted probability
y^ => predicted value

If p^ > 0.5 => y^ = 1
else y^ = 0

The line which separates the regions is called The Prediction Boundary. It's important to notice that, in the case of logistic regression the prediction boundary is a line due to the fact that it is a linear classifier.
