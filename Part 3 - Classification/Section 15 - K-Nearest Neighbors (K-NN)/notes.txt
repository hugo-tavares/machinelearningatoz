K-Nearest Neighbors

	Nonlinear classifier.

	Steps:
		1-Choose the number K of neighbors (usually 5)
		2-Take the K nearest neighbors of the new data point, according to the Euclidean distance (or other kind of distance, such as Manhattan distance)
		3-Among these K neighbors, count the number of data points in each category
		4-Assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbors
