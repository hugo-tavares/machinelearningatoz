Support Vector Machines
	The algorithm aims to find the maximum margin between the two closest points pertaining to the different classes.
	These points are considered as "support vectors" (the points are seen as vectors starting from the origin to the point).
	
	SVM are interesting because their focus is the elements which are close to the border of their classes.
	We can only use this simple svm (the linear one) when the data is linearly separable, otherwise, we need to explore different kernels
