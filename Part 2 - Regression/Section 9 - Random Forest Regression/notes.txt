Random forest is a version of Ensemble Learning, which is when you take several algorithms or the same algorithm multiple time to get a more powerful version.

Steps:
	1. Pick at random K data points from the training set
	2. Build the Decision Tree associated to these K data points
	3. Choose the number Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat Steps 1 & 2
	4. For a new data point, make each one of your Ntree trees predict the value of Y for the data point in question, and assign to the new data point the average across all of the predicted Y values
