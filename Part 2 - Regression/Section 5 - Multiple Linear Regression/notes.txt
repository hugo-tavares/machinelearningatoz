BUILDING A MODEL
5 Methods:
	1.All-in
	2.Backward Elimination          |-
	3.Forward Selection				|-	Stepwise Regression
	4.Bidirectional Elimination		|-
	5.Score Comparison
	
	1. Use all variables. Cases:
		Prior knowledge;
		You have to;
		Preparing for Backward Elimination
		
	2. Steps:
		1-Select a significance level to stay in the model (e.g. SL=0.05)
		2-Fit the full model with all possible predictors
		3-Consider the predictor with the highpes P-value. If P > SL, go to STEP 4, otherwise go to FIN
		4-Remove the predictor
		5-Fit model without this variable and go to Step 3
		
	3. Steps:
		1-Select a significance level to enter the model (e.g. SL=0.05)
		2-Fit all simple regression models y ~ xn. Select the one with the lowest P-value
		3-Keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the one(s) you already have
		4-Consider the predictor with the lowest P-value. If P < SL, go to Step 3, otherwise go to FIN.
		FIN: Keep the previous model
		
	4. Steps:
		1-Select a significance level to enter and to stay in the model e.g.: SLENTER = 0.05, SLSTAY = 0.05
		2-Perform the next step of Forward Selection (new variables must have: P < SLENTER to enter)
		3- Perform ALL steps of Backward Elimination (old variables must have P < SLSTAY to stay). Go to Step 2
		4-No new variables can enter and no old variables can exit. FIN
		
	5. All Possible Models. Steps:
		1-Select a criterion of goodnes of fit (e.g. Akaike criterion)
		2-Construct All Possible Regression Models:  2^N-1 total combinations
		3-Select the one with the best criterion
		
In the course, we will use Backward Elimination because it's the fastest one;
