Stemming = extracting the radicals of the words

BAG OF WORDS MODEL
	Create one column for each unique word present in the corpus (tokenization)
	The rows of this table will be every sentence
	The intersection of the row and the table will be how many times the word appears in the sentence
	The resulting table is a sparse matrix called bag of words
	
The most utilized classification algorithms in the field of NLP are Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest. Some other models:
	CART
	C5.0
	Maximum Entropy
