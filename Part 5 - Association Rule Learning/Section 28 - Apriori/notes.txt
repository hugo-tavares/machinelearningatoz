The algorithm has 3 parts:
	Support:
		support(M2) = # elements containing M2 / # elements
	Confidence (basically conditional probability):
		confidence(M1 -> M2) = # elements containing M1 and M2 / # elements containing M1
	Lift (improvement of probability when restricting to M1):
		lift(M1 -> M2) = confidence(M1 -> M2) / support (M2)
		
	Steps:
		1- Set a minimum support and confidence
		2- Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
		3- Take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence
		4- Sort the rules by decreasing lift
		
It is a slow algorithm because it tries all the combinations, so to mitigate this cost, we define minimum support and confidence.

It is a straight forward algorithm to find association rules, but in recommendation systems, usually more robust approaches are employed.
